[void](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3487689/is-void-a-data-type-in-c)

The void keyword can also be used in some other contexts:

* As the only parameter type in a function prototype, as in `int func(void)`, it indicates that the function has no parameters. (C++ uses empty parentheses for this, but they mean something else in C.)
* As the return type of a function, as in `void func(int n)`, it indicates that the function returns no result.
* `void*` is a pointer type that doesn't specify what it points to.
