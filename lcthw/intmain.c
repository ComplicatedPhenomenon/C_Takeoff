// The function called at program startup is named main. The implementation   declares no prototype for this function. It can be defined with no parameters:int main(void){/*...*/} or with two parameters (referred to here as argc and  argv, though any names can be used, as they are local to the function in whichthey are declared):  int main(int argc, char *argv[]}{/*...*/}
