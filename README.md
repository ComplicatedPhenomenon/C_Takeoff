# Overview of this repo
It's a repo mainly about C, few may involve C++. It aims to become a useful libraries to look up the key usage of features in C. It will obey the modern standard as much as possible.

* `lcthw` is the handy practice on the book `Learn C the Hard way` by [Zed A Shaw](https://zedshaw.com).
* `test_tools` is the recommend tools used during your C programming career.
* `GSL` is used to do scientific computation by [GNU Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

# Features of this repo
* [ ]Documentation is required.

  ‚ùå Doxygen is not idea tool to make documentation for me, I really can't agree with taste.

# Warnings and directions
The small program is tomorrow's building block in a larger project. So avoid write any one program ugly, think it over and over to make it exquisite.

There are some standards to test whether or not you are qualified to do the programming job. You won't say "I have no idea of how to be a qualified programmer" again.

## Standards to tell you whether or not you are qualified
It not hard to be a good programmer compared with to be a good physicist.

There are many resources already available online. You need to go through several tests. You can clearly see different stages which you are in along the way toward realizing what you long for.

* What basics you are supposed to know.
* There are many problems for you to take a try.          
  Tackling down the problems help you to understand how things work better.
