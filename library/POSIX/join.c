* FILE: join.c
* USAGE: gcc -pthread -lm join.c 
* DESCRIPTION:
*   This example demonstrates how to "wait" for thread completions by using
*   the Pthread join routine.  Threads are explicitly created in a joinable
*   state for portability reasons. Use of the pthread_exit status argument is
*   also shown. Compare to detached.c
