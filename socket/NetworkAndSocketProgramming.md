[An right way](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/586000/Networking-and-Socket-Programming-Tutorial-in-C) to start network and socket programming.

I have books and ppt on my hard disk.
* Web Socket by  Andrew Lombardi
* Network Programmability and Automation by Jason Edelman, Scott S. Lowe & Matt Oswalt

  It is quite from my area.
* Introduction to Sockets Programming in C using TCP/IP by Professor Panagiota Fatourou.

  It is straightforward. Nevertheless there is still hidden gaps between my poor knowledge and what he was talking about.
