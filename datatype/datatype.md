`"%f"` is the (or at least one) correct format for a double. There is no format for a `float`, because if you attempt to pass a `float` to `printf`, it'll be promoted to double before printf receives it1. `"%lf"` is also acceptable under the current standard -- the `l` is specified as having no effect if followed by the f conversion specifier (among others).

Note that this is one place that `printf` format strings differ substantially from `scanf` (and `fscanf`, etc.) format strings. For output, you're passing a value, which will be promoted from float to `double` when passed as a variadic parameter. For input you're passing a pointer, which is not promoted, so you have to tell `scanf` whether you want to read a `float` or a `double`, so for `scanf`, `%f` means you want to read a float and `%lf` means you want to read a `double` (and, for what it's worth, for a long double, you use `%Lf` for either printf or scanf).
