# Red black tree
Like AVL, Red Black tree is another way to balance binary search tree. Red black tree's property includes property of BST and other specific property.

> A red-black tree is a type of binary search tree. It is self balancing like the AVL tree, though it uses different properties to maintain the invariant of being balanced. Balanced binary search trees are much more efficient at search than unbalanced binary search trees, so the complexity needed to maintain balance is often worth it.

## Tasks to enable you get familiar with RBT
- [x] Construct a `red black tree` at the beginning.
  * [RBTree.c](./RBTree.c)
- [ ] Turn a `binary search tree` into a `red black tree`
* Prove the property of RBT makes a tree as a balanced BST.

## Application of `red black tree`
- [ ] Implement `set` with `red black tree`
