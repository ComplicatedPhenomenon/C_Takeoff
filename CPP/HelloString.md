You can assign to any string object using =. This replaces the previous contents of the string with whatever is on the right-hand side, and you don’t have to worry about what happens to the previous contents—that’s handled automatically for you. To combine strings you simply use the + operator, which also allows you to combine character arrays with strings. If you want to append either a string or a character array to another string, you can use the operator +=. Finally, note that iostream already knows what to do with strings, so you can just send a string (or an
expression that produces a string, which happens withs1 + s2 + "!") directly to cout in order to print it.
